### Fundamental Difference: Temporal Dependency vs. Parallel Independence

The key distinction between your two versions lies in how they handle **temporal dependencies** in the heat transfer simulation. Let me break this down with a physical analogy:

#### Incorrect Version: Broken Time Chain
```c
// Problematic parallel approach
#pragma omp for schedule(dynamic)
for (int h = 0; h < nr_hour; h++) {
    memcpy(T_n_local.values, T_n_initial.values, nodes * sizeof(double));
    // ... computes hour independently ...
}
```

**What's Wrong:**
1. **Physics Violation**: Heat transfer is a time-dependent process where each hour's initial condition depends on the previous hour's final state. By resetting to `T_n_initial` every hour, you're essentially creating 3672 independent simulations starting from 0°C.

2. **Numerical Artifacts**: 
   - Hour 100 starts at 0°C instead of the correct temperature from hour 99
   - The final "incorrect" values are essentially random because they don't accumulate physical changes

3. **Visualization**:
   ```
   Time: 0h → 1h → 2h → ... → 3672h  (Correct: Continuous process)
   Your version: 0h→1h  0h→2h  ... 0h→3672h (Parallel branches)
   ```

#### Correct Version: Physics-Preserving Parallelism
```c
// Correct approach
1. Serial warmup (24h) → establishes physical initial conditions
2. Parallel computation with state propagation:
   #pragma omp critical
   memcpy(T_local.values, T_n.values, ...);  // Get current state
   compute_hour(...);                        // Advance physics
   #pragma omp critical
   memcpy(T_n.values, T_local.values, ...);  // Update global state
```

**Why It Works:**
1. **Temporal Continuity**: Each hour starts from the exact end state of the previous hour
2. **Controlled Parallelism**: Only parallelizes across hours after establishing valid initial conditions
3. **Error Sources**:
   - The 0.0001% error comes from floating-point non-associativity when different threads compute:
     ```math
     a + (b + c) vs (a + b) + c
     ```
   - No physics is violated - just microscopic rounding differences

### Deep Technical Analysis

**Memory Access Patterns:**
| Version | Memory Behavior | Effect |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Incorrect | Each hour writes independently | No cumulative physics |
| Correct | Strict read-modify-write sequence | Preserves temporal dependencies |

**Numerical Stability:**
```python
# Incorrect (Python-like pseudocode)
for hour in parallel_hours:
    T = initial_condition  # Disaster - throws away previous state
    for step in time_steps:
        T = solve_heat_eq(T)

# Correct
T = warmup_condition
for hour in parallel_hours:
    T_local = get_current_state(T)  # Critical section
    for step in time_steps:
        T_local = solve_heat_eq(T_local)
    update_global_state(T, T_local)  # Critical section
```

### Physical Interpretation

Consider a metal rod being heated at one end:
- **Correct Version**: Like a real rod, each time step transfers heat gradually along its length
  ```
  Start: [0° 0° 0° 0°] → After 1h: [20° 5° 1° 0°] → After 2h: [25° 15° 4° 1°]
  ```
- **Incorrect Version**: Each hour pretends the rod starts cold
  ```
  Hour1: [0°→20°→5°→1°] 
  Hour2: [0°→25°→15°→4°] (Ignores Hour1's state!)
  ```

### Why 0.0001% Error is Acceptable

1. **Floating-Point Reality**:
   - Double precision has 15-17 significant digits
   - Your error (0.0001% = 1e-6) leaves 9+ accurate digits

2. **Engineering Standards**:
   - Typical temperature sensors have ±0.5°C error
   - Your difference: 0.0001% of 10°C = 0.00001°C

3. **Energy Conservation Test**:
   ```c
   double total_energy = 0.0;
   for (int i = 0; i < nodes*nr_hour; i++) total_energy += T_nh.data[i];
   printf("Energy diff: %.10f J\n", fabs(total_energy - expected_energy));
   ```
   This will show identical energy conservation in both versions.

### Final Recommendation

1. **Keep the correct version**
2. **Add validation checks**:
   ```c
   assert(fabs(T_n.values[0] - expected_boundary_temp) < 1e-6);
   ```
3. **Document the expected error**:
   ```c
   printf("# PHYSICAL MODEL PRESERVED - PARALLEL ERROR <1e-6 RELATIVE\n");
   ```

The "incorrect" version isn't just inaccurate - it solves a completely different (and unphysical) problem. The correct version gives you both:
- Physically meaningful results
- Parallel speedup
- Negligible numerical differences
